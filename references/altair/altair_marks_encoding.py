def _(mo):

    The first ingredient in effective visualization is the input data. Data values can represent different forms of measurement. What kinds of comparisons do those measurements support? And what kinds of visual encodings then support those comparisons?

    We will start by looking at the basic data types that Altair uses to inform visual encoding choices. These data types determine the kinds of comparisons we can make, and thereby guide our visualization design decisions.

    ### Nominal (N)

    *Nominal* data (also called *categorical* data) consist of category names.

    With nominal data we can compare the equality of values: *is value A the same or different than value B? (A = B)*, supporting statements like “A is equal to B” or “A is not equal to B”.
    In the dataset above, the `country` field is nominal.

    When visualizing nominal data we should readily be able to see if values are the same or different: position, color hue (blue, red, green, *etc.*), and shape can help. However, using a size channel to encode nominal data might mislead us, suggesting rank-order or magnitude differences among values that do not exist!

    ### Ordinal (O)

    *Ordinal* data consist of values that have a specific ordering.

    With ordinal data we can compare the rank-ordering of values: *does value A come before or after value B? (A < B)*, supporting statements like “A is less than B” or “A is greater than B”.
    In the dataset above, we can treat the `year` field as ordinal.

    When visualizing ordinal data, we should perceive a sense of rank-order. Position, size, or color value (brightness) might be appropriate, where as color hue (which is not perceptually ordered) would be less appropriate.

    ### Quantitative (Q)

    With *quantitative* data we can measure numerical differences among values. There are multiple sub-types of quantitative data:

    For *interval* data we can measure the distance (interval) between points: *what is the distance to value A from value B? (A - B)*, supporting statements such as “A is 12 units away from B”.

    For *ratio* data the zero-point is meaningful and so we can also measure proportions or scale factors: *value A is what proportion of value B? (A / B)*, supporting statements such as “A is 10% of B” or “B is 7 times larger than A”.

    In the dataset above, `year` is a quantitative interval field (the value of year "zero" is subjective), whereas `fertility` and `life_expect` are quantitative ratio fields (zero is meaningful for calculating proportions).
    Vega-Lite represents quantitative data, but does not make a distinction between interval and ratio types.

    Quantitative values can be visualized using position, size, or color value, among other channels. An axis with a zero baseline is essential for proportional comparisons of ratio values, but can be safely omitted for interval comparisons.

    ### Temporal (T)

    *Temporal* values measure time points or intervals. This type is a special case of quantitative values (timestamps) with rich semantics and conventions (i.e., the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar)). The temporal type in Vega-Lite supports reasoning about time units (year, month, day, hour, etc.), and provides methods for requesting specific time intervals.

    Example temporal values include date strings such as `“2019-01-04”` and `“Jan 04 2019”`, as well as standardized date-times such as the [ISO date-time format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): `“2019-01-04T17:50:35.643Z”`.

    There are no temporal values in our global development dataset above, as the `year` field is simply encoded as an integer. For more details about using temporal data in Altair, see the [Times and Dates documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/times_and_dates.html).

    ### Summary

    These data types are not mutually exclusive, but rather form a hierarchy: ordinal data support nominal (equality) comparisons, while quantitative data support ordinal (rank-order) comparisons.

    Moreover, these data types do _not_ provide a fixed categorization. Just because a data field is represented using a number doesn't mean we have to treat it as a quantitative type! For example, we might interpret a set of ages (10 years old, 20 years old, etc) as nominal (underage or overage), ordinal (grouped by year), or quantitative (calculate average age).

    Now let's examine how to visually encode these data types!

    ## Encoding Channels

    At the heart of Altair is the use of *encodings* that bind data fields (with a given data type) to available encoding *channels* of a chosen *mark* type. In this notebook we'll examine the following encoding channels:

    - `x`: Horizontal (x-axis) position of the mark.
    - `y`: Vertical (y-axis) position of the mark.
    - `size`: Size of the mark. May correspond to area or length, depending on the mark type.
    - `color`: Mark color, specified as a [legal CSS color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).
    - `opacity`: Mark opacity, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
    - `shape`: Plotting symbol shape for `point` marks.
    - `tooltip`: Tooltip text to display upon mouse hover over the mark.
    - `order`: Mark ordering, determines line/area point order and drawing order.
    - `column`: Facet the data into horizontally-aligned subplots.
    - `row`: Facet the data into vertically-aligned subplots.

    For a complete list of available channels, see the [Altair encoding documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html).

    ## Graphical Marks

    Our exploration of encoding channels above exclusively uses `point` marks to visualize the data. However, the `point` mark type is only one of the many geometric shapes that can be used to visually represent data. Altair includes a number of built-in mark types, including:

    - `mark_area()` - Filled areas defined by a top-line and a baseline.
    - `mark_bar()` -	Rectangular bars.
    - `mark_circle()`	- Scatter plot points as filled circles.
    - `mark_line()` - Connected line segments.
    - `mark_point()` - Scatter plot points with configurable shapes.
    - `mark_rect()` - Filled rectangles, useful for heatmaps.
    - `mark_rule()` - Vertical or horizontal lines spanning the axis.
    - `mark_square()` - Scatter plot points as filled squares.
    - `mark_text()` - Scatter plot points represented by text.
    - `mark_tick()` - Vertical or horizontal tick marks.

    For a complete list, and links to examples, see the [Altair marks documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html). Next, we will step through a number of the most commonly used mark types for statistical graphics.

    ### Point Marks

    The `point` mark type conveys specific points, as in *scatter plots* and *dot plots*. In addition to `x` and `y` encoding channels (to specify 2D point positions), point marks can use `color`, `size`, and `shape` encodings to convey additional data fields.

    We've completed our tour of data types, encoding channels, and graphical marks! You should now be well-equipped to further explore the space of encodings, mark types, and mark parameters. For a comprehensive reference &ndash; including features we've skipped over here! &ndash; see the Altair [marks](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html) and [encoding](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html) documentation.

    In the next module, we will look at the use of data transformations to create charts that summarize data or visualize new derived fields. In a later module, we'll examine how to further customize your charts by modifying scales, axes, and legends.

    - The systematic study of marks, visual encodings, and backing data types was initiated by [Jacques Bertin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin) in his pioneering 1967 work [_Sémiologie Graphique (The Semiology of Graphics)_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Semiology_of_Graphics.html?id=X5caQwAACAAJ). The image above illustrates position, size, value (brightness), texture, color (hue), orientation, and shape channels, alongside Bertin's recommendations for the data types they support.
    - The framework of data types, marks, and channels also guides _automated_ visualization design tools, starting with [Mackinlay's APT (A Presentation Tool)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10191273548472217907) in 1986 and continuing in more recent systems such as [Voyager](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/voyager/) and [Draco](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/draco/).
    - The identification of nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio types dates at least as far back as S. S. Steven's 1947 article [_On the theory of scales of measurement_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14356809180080326415).
